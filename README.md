# DelegateX

A non-custodial delegated trading platform that enables users to grant limited trading authority while maintaining full asset control. All trades and performance metrics are recorded immutably on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Overview

DelegateX is a delegated trading platform that enables clients to grant limited, non-custodial trading authority to managers, with performance results recorded immutably on the Ethereum blockchain. The platform addresses the challenge of verifiable delegated management of assets when trading execution occurs off-chain via centralized brokerage APIs, while storing only performance metrics on-chain.

### Original Vision: Delegated Trading Platform Architecture Roadmap (V1.0 - V3.0)
- **V1.0**: Hackathon MVP proving core concepts of delegated authority (ERC-20 approve/permit) and on-chain performance tracking
- **V2.0**: Integration with real brokerage APIs and traditional assets
- **V3.0**: Full production platform with advanced features

### Current Status: v0.8 (Hackathon MVP - Proof of Concept)
This version proves the core concepts with mock ERC-20 tokens, ERC-20 approve() delegation, and on-chain performance tracking via stubbed off-chain engine.

#### âœ… Completed Features (v0.8)
- **Non-Custodial Trading**: Assets remain in user wallets at all times
- **On-Chain Trade Logging**: All trades recorded via Ethereum smart contract (TradeLogger.sol)
- **P&L Calculation**: Automatic profit/loss computation for completed trading cycles
- **Portfolio Sharing**: Shareable portfolio views with unique hashes
- **Mock Delegation**: Simulated delegation interface using ERC-20 approve() mechanism
- **Performance Analytics**: Charts and statistics for trade performance
- **Multi-Database Support**: Switch between Supabase and MongoDB backends
- **Wallet Integration**: Connect Ethereum wallets for on-chain interactions
- **ERC-20 Delegation**: Client uses ERC-20 approve() to delegate spending limits to manager wallet
- **On-Chain Performance Tracking**: PerformanceTracker.sol contract for recording metrics

#### ðŸš§ Planned for v0.9 (Enhanced MVP)
- **Off-Chain Engine Integration**: Replace stubbed P&L with basic FastAPI simulation engine
- **Improved Delegation UI**: Enhanced delegation setup with clearer permission controls
- **Real-Time Performance Updates**: Live updates from off-chain engine to on-chain contracts
- **Basic Risk Management**: Position size limits and basic stop-loss simulation
- **Enhanced Testing**: Comprehensive smart contract test suite

#### ðŸŽ¯ Roadmap to v1.0 (Production Ready)
- **Real Brokerage Integration**: Connect to actual brokerage APIs (Alpaca, Interactive Brokers)
- **Traditional Asset Support**: Enable trading of equities and fiat currencies
- **Advanced Delegation Controls**: Granular permissions (max position sizes, asset restrictions, time limits)
- **Production Smart Contracts**: Audited contracts with multi-sig controls
- **Institutional Features**: White-label options, compliance tools, enterprise APIs
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Ethereum mainnet + Layer 2 solutions

- **TradeForm**: Input form for logging trades (supports PyUSD stablecoin)
- **TradesList**: Display of logged trades
- **PnLDisplay**: Profit/loss calculations and history
- **DelegationPanel**: Mock interface for delegation setup with PyUSD recommendations
- **PyUSDFeatures**: Dedicated component showcasing PyUSD benefits for delegated trading
- **PerformanceChart**: Visual representation of trading performance
- **Wallet**: Ethereum wallet connection and display

### Database Schema
Supports both Supabase (PostgreSQL) and MongoDB with tables/collections for:
- Users
- Trades
- P&L results
- Delegations (future)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file with:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   VITE_MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Smart Contract Development**
   ```bash
   # Install Hardhat dependencies
   npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle chai ethereum-waffle

   # Run tests
   npx hardhat test
   ```

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Deployment
The app can be deployed to any static hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, etc.) or via Lovable's publish feature.
