# Create README.md and BUSINESS.md for DelegaterX

## Information Gathered
- DelegateX is a delegated trading platform enabling clients to grant non-custodial trading authority to managers, with performance recorded on Ethereum blockchain.
- Original vision: V1.0 Hackathon MVP proving ERC-20 approve/permit delegation and on-chain performance tracking; V2.0 real brokerage APIs; V3.0 full platform.
- Current v0.8: MVP with ERC-20 delegation, TradeLogger.sol, PerformanceTracker.sol, mock off-chain engine, portfolio transparency.
- v0.9: Enhanced MVP with FastAPI engine, better delegation UI, risk management.
- v1.0: Real brokerage integration (Alpaca, IB), traditional assets (equities, fiat), production contracts.

## Plan
1. Update README.md with developer documentation including original vision, current v0.8 status, v0.9/v1.0 roadmap.
2. Create BUSINESS.md with business overview, current v0.8 capabilities, v0.9 enhancements, v1.0+ roadmap, market opportunity.

## Dependent Files to be Edited/Created

# Ensure Hardhat Works Locally for Testing

## Information Gathered
- Hardhat is configured minimally in hardhat.config.js with Solidity 0.8.4.
- Smart contract: TradeLogger.sol in smart_contracts/.
- Dependencies: Hardhat and related plugins in package.json devDependencies.
- No existing tests found; need to check and possibly create.

## Plan
1. Install project dependencies to ensure Hardhat is available.
2. Compile smart contracts to verify setup.
3. Check for and run tests; create basic tests if none exist.
4. Update hardhat.config.js for local testing (add networks if needed).
5. Verify local Hardhat node can be started.

## Dependent Files to be Edited/Created
- hardhat.config.js: May need updates for networks.
- test/ directory: If tests are missing, create basic test files.

## Followup Steps
- Test contract deployment on local network.
- Ensure integration with frontend if applicable.

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Install dependencies (npm install)
- [x] Compile contracts (npx hardhat compile)
- [x] Check for tests and run them (npx hardhat test)
- [x] Update hardhat.config.js for local testing
- [x] Start local Hardhat node and verify
