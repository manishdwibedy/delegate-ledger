# DelegateX - Business Overview

## Revolutionizing Delegated Trading with Blockchain Transparency

DelegateX is a pioneering non-custodial delegated trading platform that empowers portfolio owners to grant limited trading authority to skilled traders while maintaining complete control over their assets. By leveraging Ethereum smart contracts, DelegateX ensures all trading activities and performance metrics are recorded immutably on-chain, creating unprecedented transparency and trust in the delegated trading ecosystem.

## What DelegateX Does Today (v0.8 MVP - Hackathon Proof of Concept)

### âœ… Completed Core Capabilities
DelegateX v0.8 proves the fundamental concepts of delegated authority using ERC-20 approve/permit and on-chain performance tracking with minimal external integration.

#### 1. **ERC-20 Based Non-Custodial Delegation**
- Clients use standard ERC-20 `approve()` to delegate spending limits of mock tokens to manager wallets
- Assets remain in client wallets at all times - no custody transfer required
- Simulates the core delegation mechanism that will power traditional asset management

#### 2. **On-Chain Performance Tracking**
- `PerformanceTracker.sol` smart contract records performance metrics immutably
- Accepts calls only from designated manager wallets for security
- Simple `recordPerformance(uint256 netPnl, uint256 tvl)` function for MVP

#### 3. **Mock Off-Chain Engine**
- Stubbed FastAPI simulation engine (currently internal logic only)
- Generates simulated daily P&L calculations (e.g., 0.1% returns)
- Framework ready for real brokerage API integration

#### 4. **Trade Logging & P&L Calculation**
- Users log buy/sell trades directly to Ethereum smart contracts (`TradeLogger.sol`)
- Smart contracts automatically calculate profit/loss for completed trading cycles
- Transparent cost basis tracking using FIFO methodology

#### 5. **Portfolio Transparency & Sharing**
- Shareable portfolio views with unique hash-based URLs
- Public performance dashboards for accountability
- Immutable trade history accessible to all stakeholders

#### 6. **PyUSD Stablecoin Integration**
- PayPal's PyUSD stablecoin support for delegated trading
- Price-stable delegation limits ($1.00 peg maintained)
- Enhanced risk management with predictable dollar values
- Institutional-grade security and regulatory compliance

#### 7. **Multi-Database Architecture**
- Flexible backend supporting both Supabase and MongoDB
- Stores mock trading events and calculated metrics
- Scalable architecture for future growth

### Target Users (v0.8)
